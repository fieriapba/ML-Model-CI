DOOM 3 BFG Edition also includes copies of the original DOOM (the Ultimate Doom edition with the add-on fourth episode, "Thy Flesh Consumed"), and DOOM II with the expansion No Rest for the Living, previously available for the Xbox 360. These classic games have been optimized for modern platforms and offer online multiplayer modes.
 
In DOOM 3, you play as a marine who must fight your way through a demonic invasion that has overwhelmed the Union Aerospace Corporation's Mars research facility. You will face terrifying enemies and bosses, use a variety of weapons and gadgets, and uncover the secrets behind the ancient civilization that once inhabited the planet.
 
In Resurrection of Evil, you play as another marine who returns to the facility two years later to investigate a mysterious beacon buried deep in the ruins. You will encounter new demons, wield new weapons such as the double-barreled shotgun, and acquire demonic powers that let you control time and gravity.
 
In The Lost Mission, you play as the last surviving member of Bravo team, which was seen being ambushed by demons in DOOM 3. You will be contacted by a scientist who asks you to help him destroy an experimental teleportation array that is held by the demons in Hell. The array is powerful enough to send an army of demons to Earth, so you must stop it at all costs.

DOOM 3 BFG Edition is not only a remastered version of DOOM 3, but also a tribute to the legacy of the DOOM franchise. It pays homage to the original games that revolutionized the first-person shooter genre and influenced countless other games. It also offers new challenges and surprises for fans and newcomers alike.
 
One of the most notable features of DOOM 3 BFG Edition is the armor-mounted flashlight, which replaces the original game's mechanic of switching between the flashlight and the weapon. This allows you to illuminate dark areas and shoot enemies at the same time, making the game more fluid and dynamic. However, it also adds a new layer of strategy, as you have to manage your flashlight's battery life and avoid attracting unwanted attention.
 
Another feature of DOOM 3 BFG Edition is the support for 3D displays and head-mounted displays (HMD), such as the Oculus Rift. This enhances the immersion and realism of the game, making you feel like you are actually on Mars fighting demons. You can adjust the settings to your preference and enjoy the game in a whole new way.
 
DOOM 3 BFG Edition also includes an online multiplayer mode for up to four players, where you can team up or compete with other players in various maps and modes. You can choose from different characters, weapons, and power-ups, and customize your gameplay experience. You can also play the classic DOOM and DOOM II games online with up to three other players.
 
DOOM 3 BFG Edition is a must-have for any DOOM fan or horror/action lover. It offers hours of thrilling and terrifying gameplay, with stunning graphics and sound effects. It also gives you access to the classic DOOM games that started it all. You can download it for free from Skidrow Reloaded, a reliable source of cracked PC games.
