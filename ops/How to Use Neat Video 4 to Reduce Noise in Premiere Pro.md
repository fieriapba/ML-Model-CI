## Step 1: Install Neat Video 4 Plug-in for Premiere
  
To install the Neat Video 4 plug-in for Premiere, you need to download the installer from the [Neat Video website](https://www.neatvideo.com/download). Make sure you have started Premiere Pro at least once before installing the plug-in. Then, run the installer and follow the instructions. If the installer does not automatically find the location of Premiere Pro, you need to specify it manually. After the installation is complete, you should find Neat Video > Reduce Noise v4 in the Premiere Proâs Effect menu.
  
## Step 2: Add Neat Video Effect to Your Video Clip
  
To apply Neat Video 4 to your video clip, you need to add it to the project and the sequence in Premiere Pro. Then, select the clip in the Timeline window and drag-n-drop the Neat Video effect from the Effects window into it. Alternatively, you can right-click on the clip and choose Effect > Neat Video > Reduce Noise v4.
  
## Step 3: Configure Neat Video Settings
  
To configure Neat Video settings, you need to open the Effect Controls window and click on Setup... under Neat Video. This will launch the Neat Video window where you can adjust various parameters to optimize the noise reduction. The main steps are:
  
- Build a noise profile for your clip by selecting a frame with uniform noise and clicking on Auto Profile.
- Check the noise reduction quality by switching between Preview modes and adjusting the Temporal and Spatial filters.
- Optionally, use other tools such as Dust and Scratches, Sharpening, Flicker Reduction and Jitter Reduction to enhance your clip.
- Click Apply to save the settings and close the Neat Video window.

## Step 4: Render Your Video Clip
  
To render your video clip with Neat Video noise reduction, you need to use the Sequence > Render Effects in Work Area menu item in Premiere Pro. This will apply Neat Video noise reduction to the whole clip or the selected work area. You can then preview or export your video clip as usual.
