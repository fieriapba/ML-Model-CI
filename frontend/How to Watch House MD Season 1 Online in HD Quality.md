House MD Season 1 is widely regarded as one of the best seasons of the show, as it introduces the main characters, their dynamics, and the medical mysteries that challenge them. The season also features some of the most memorable cases, such as the pilot episode where House diagnoses a teacher with cerebral vasculitis, the episode where House revives a jazz musician against his DNR order, and the episode where House tells three stories of his past to a class of medical students.
 
One of the main themes of House MD Season 1 is House's conflict with Edward Vogler, a billionaire who becomes the chairman of the board of Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital after donating $100 million. Vogler tries to impose his business-oriented vision on the hospital, and clashes with House over his unconventional methods, his disregard for authority, and his expensive treatments. Vogler eventually forces House to fire one of his team members, and tries to get him fired as well. However, House manages to outsmart Vogler and expose his ulterior motives, leading to Vogler's dismissal from the board.
 
Another theme of House MD Season 1 is House's relationship with Stacy Warner, his ex-girlfriend who reappears in the final two episodes. Stacy was House's lawyer when he suffered an infarction in his leg that left him with chronic pain and a limp. She authorized a risky surgery that saved House's life but damaged his leg further, causing him to resent her and break up with her. Stacy comes back to seek House's help for her husband, who has a mysterious illness that only House can diagnose. House struggles with his feelings for Stacy, and has to decide whether to help her or not.
